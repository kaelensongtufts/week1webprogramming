        <p id="imgText">My favorite place is the Southern California desert. <br> <br>
            This ecosystem is so unique--I've yet to see a landscape like this anywhere else in the world.
            I have so many memories in natural places that look just like the one this picture. The desert
            is enchanting and magical when you find a natural swimming hole in the middle of nowhere. </p>

    •	Your IP address (i.e., the IP address where your computer is located)
    •	The location where you grew up
    •	A picture of your favorite place and a sentence or two about why it’s your favorite place.  
    The text must wrap around to the right of the image.  You may not use a <table> element to accomplish this.
    
                  This is an example of an image
                  with text wrapped to the right.
      And there is more text!
    
    •	A link to your favorite restaurant (should open in a new tab)
    •	Something no one would expect about you -->
